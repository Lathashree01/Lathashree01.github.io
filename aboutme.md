Hello there 👋 

I'm Lathashree Harisha, your friendly neighborhood tech enthusiast with a penchant for all things positive. By day, I navigate the exciting world of technology as a Woman In Tech, making machines intelligent through every line of code.

AI and ML? Consider me hooked 😍 
I'm that person who gets excited about unraveling the mysteries behind algorithms, turning the binary into a playground of possibilities or trying out new technology that I randomly read on LinkedIn.

Now, when I'm not immersed in the digital realm, you will find me lacing up my trekking boots, exploring new corners of the world, or deep in a good book/rom-com movie. Life is an adventure, and I'm here to code it with joy and laughter. 

Join me on this journey where the love for technology meets the thrill of exploration. Cheers to bytes, books, and the beautiful chaos in between! 🚀💡
